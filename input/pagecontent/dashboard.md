> Special case Index-patterns
>
> Index-patterns are created with the $reset operation (there are multiple for each API e.g. Air, HPI, NHI,â€¦ and each operation will create its own index-patterns depending on the seed data).
>
> There seems to be a bug - For the index patterns to take effect the first time in the Dashboard (to see the index-patterns, use the visualisation dashboard and prevent Errors) the OpenSearch UI needs to be refreshed.

> This can be achieved via switching to the Private tenant and back to Global tenant (only necessary once).
